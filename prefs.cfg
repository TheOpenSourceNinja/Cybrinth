//Single-line comments like this are allowed, and must begin with two slashes (//). Anything before the slashes is considered not part of a comment.
//Preference and value must be separated by a tab character, not spaces.
//Any preference not specified here will use its default value. The same goes for things specified in invalid ways (i.e. putting letters where numbers should be).
//Preferences must be spelled exactly as they are in this original file, but are not case-sensitive. "Play music" is the same as "PLAY muSic" but not "Playmusic"

Fullscreen:	true //Default: false. Determines whether we try to use full-screen graphics.

Bits per pixel:	8 //Default: 8. Determines the color depth when running in fullscreen. Note that on the vast majority of systems, changing this setting will have no visible effect.

Wait for vertical sync:	true //Default: true. Set this to false if the game seems slow, but expect graphical 'ripping' of moving objects.

Driver type:	opengl //Default: OpenGL. Possible values are OpenGL, Direct3D9, Direct3D8, Burning's Video, Software, and NULL (only for testing, do not use!). If the selected driver type is not available for your system, the game will automatically choose one that is.

Number of players:	2 //Default: 1. The game supports up to 4 human players on one keyboard. Online play to come soon. Must be an integer greater than or equal to the number of AI bots. The game supports up to a hypothetical limit of 255 players total including bots.

Number of bots:	1 //Default: 0. Sets the number of AI bots you play against. Must be an integer less than or equal to the number of players.

Window size:	640x480 //Default: 640x480. Determines how big the game window will be in pixels. The numbers must be separated by an x. Only applicable if not running in fullscreen. If running in fullscreen, the screen resolution will be detected automatically. Playability is not guaranteed at sizes below the default.

Play music:	false //Default: true. If set to true, the game will search for music files in the ./music folder and attempt to play them. Supported music formats may vary from system to system, but generally will include WAVE (.wav), MOD (.mod, .xm, .s3m, .669, .it, or .med), MIDI (.mid), Ogg Vorbis (.ogg), MP3 (.mp3), and FLAC (.flac).

Volume:	100 //Default: 100. Sets the music volume. Must be an integer between 0 and 100.

Network port:	61187 //Default: 61187. This controls which port the server listens for connections on and the clients will attempt to connect to. Ports below 1024 may not work if you're on a Unix-like system and don't have superuser privileges, see https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers&oldid=501310028#Well-known_ports

Enable joystick:	false //Default: false. If enabled, the program will try to detect and use a joystick

Joystick number:	1 //Default: 1. Joysticks are numbered starting with 0. Mine is number 1, so that's the default.

Always server:	true //Default: True until we get networking working. Sets whether this copy of the program will always assume itself to be a server or ask.

Debug:	true //Default: false. Makes the program output more text to standard output. Also makes the AIs insanely fast.

Mark player trails:	true //Default: false. Makes solving the maze easier by marking where you've already been.

Show background animations:	true //Default: true. Setting this to false can really speed the game up on slow systems like the Raspberry Pi.
