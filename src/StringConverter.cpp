/**
This class exists just to convert between Irrlicht's wide character strings and TagLib's wide character strings. I have no idea whether I'm doing it right. I just want to make sure this program can work with non-English characters. If anyone can suggest a way to improve my code, fix any bugs, or whatever, PLEASE send in a patch!
