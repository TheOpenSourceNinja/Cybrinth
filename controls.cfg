//Single-line comments like this are allowed, and must begin with two slashes (//). Anything before the slashes is considered not part of a comment.
//Action and control must be separated by a tab character, not spaces.
//NOT TRUE RIGHT NOW: Any action not specified here will use its default value. The same goes for things specified in invalid ways (i.e. putting letters where numbers should be).
//Actions must be spelled exactly as they are in this original file, but are not case-sensitive. "Screenshot" is the same as "SCREENshoT" but not "screeeeen    shot"
//Controls can be assigned to multiple actions. Actions can be assigned to multiple controls. One assignment per line.
//Keyboard controls must use integer keycodes.

screenshot	42 //Print screen.
SCREENSHOT	80 //Not all computers have a print screen key, so let's accept the P key too.
ScreenShot	44 //I've never seen a keyboard with this key, but apparently they exist.
//Note that the action can either be spelled out ("down") or abbreviated ("d")
//For controls that affect a specific player, start with "Player", then a space, then the player number, another space, then the action, then a tab, and finally the control.
