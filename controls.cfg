//Action and control must be separated by a tab character, not spaces.
//NOT TRUE RIGHT NOW: Any action not specified here will use its default value. The same goes for things specified in invalid ways (i.e. putting letters where numbers should be).
//Actions must be spelled exactly as they are in this original file, but are not case-sensitive. "Screenshot" is the same as "SCREENshoT" but not "screeeeen    shot"
//Controls can be assigned to multiple actions. Actions can be assigned to multiple controls. One assignment per line.
